# üß† ML_Project

This repository contains a series of hands-on **Machine Learning projects** implemented using Python and popular ML libraries. It is designed to demonstrate practical applications of classical supervised learning algorithms, including **Linear Regression** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, with clear documentation, step-by-step explanation, and data-driven model evaluation. 

The project was developed as part of my undergraduate exploration into applied machine learning and serves as a portfolio of foundational ML implementations.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Understand and implement classic supervised learning models from scratch and using `scikit-learn`.
- Learn the full ML workflow: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and tuning.
- Work with real-world datasets to build predictive models.
- Visualize and interpret results to understand model performance and limitations.
